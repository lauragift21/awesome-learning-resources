Thank you for your interest in contributing to Awesome Learning Resources, contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**
This guide helps make contributing to Awesome Learning Resources simple and efficient for everyone.

## Idea

I created this repository because I wanted to keep track of all the awesome resources I find on the web. Ranging from tips on front end development, developer blogs, what's new in JavaScript and so on.

## Guidelines

1. Feel free to contribute - make your changes and submit a PR.
2. If adding a new topic, please follow an alphabetical order. Why?? Well because it helps other people locate the resources with ease.
3. Individual resources do not have to be in alphabetical order.
4. When creating a new topic, please make sure to add it to the Table of Contents

**Happy Exploring!!** :fire:
